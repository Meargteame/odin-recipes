    steps
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li><p>Gather Ingredients: Collect all the ingredients you'll need, including ground meat (such as beef, chicken, or a plant-based alternative), burger buns, lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese (if desired), and condiments like ketchup and mayonnaise.</p></li>
    <li><p>Preheat Grill or Skillet: Preheat your grill or stovetop skillet over medium-high heat. Make sure it's hot before cooking the burgers.</p></li>
    <li><p>Shape Burger Patties: Divide the ground meat into equal portions and shape them into burger patties. Season both sides with salt and pepper or any preferred seasonings.</p></li>
    <li><p>Cook Patties: Place the burger patties on the hot grill or skillet. Cook for a few minutes on each side, flipping only once, until they reach your preferred level of doneness (e.g., medium-rare, medium, or well-done).</p></li>
    <li><p>Toast Buns: While the patties are cooking, you can lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster. This adds a nice crunch to the buns.</p></li>
    <li><p>Assemble Burgers: Start by placing lettuce leaves on the bottom half of the bun. Add a slice of tomato, onion, and cheese (if using). Put the cooked burger patty on top of the toppings. Add condiments like ketchup and mayonnaise on the top bun.</p></li>
    <li><p>Serve: Place the top half of the bun on the assembled burger. Serve your homemade burger with your favorite side dishes, such as fries or coleslaw.</p></li>
    <li><p>Enjoy your delicious homemade burger! You can also customize it with additional toppings like pickles, bacon, or special sauces to suit your taste preferences.</p></li>
